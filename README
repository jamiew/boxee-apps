Repository with a few video applications for Boxee. 
Right now these are just simple RSS applications + customized feeds --
Boxee likes feeds with 200x200 <media:thumbnail>'s and some <boxee:display> mods

The apps:
* Magma Must Watch: http://mag.ma/mustwatch
* Know Your Meme: http://knowyourmeme.com/episodes
* Rocketboom: http://www.rocketboom.com

A quick screencast of the install & kicking the tires:
